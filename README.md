- 🌱 I’m currently learning ruby on rails at Le Wagon.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any ruby projects.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Currently living in Tokyo, mid-life career change to become a web developer and enjoying every bit of it.  I look forward to Japan winters because the snowboarding here is the best!
